# Daily Work Planner

## Description

This project was created to give people an option to have an esay-to-use in-browser day planner.
As a developer this gave me an opportunity to read up on the documentation for the popular and frequently-used [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) JavaScript libraries and get used to using them in my own projects. It was also an additional chance to work with local storage!
